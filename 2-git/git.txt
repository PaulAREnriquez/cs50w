Git

'git' is a command-line tool that allows us to:

1. Keep track of changes that we make to the code
2. Synchronizes code between different people
3. Test changes to code (on a separate branch) without losing the original
4. Revert back to old versions of our code

Cloning a Repository
- Takes a repository from the Github server and download it in our own computer
- The repository and all its contents will now be downloaded to your local computer

`git clone <url>`

Commit
The savepoint state of the current files that you want to keep track of

If you want to keep track of individual files and not other files:
`git add <filename>`
