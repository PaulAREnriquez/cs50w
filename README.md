# cs50w
This is my personal compilation of files created in live demos from the course CS50W: CS50's Web Programming with Python and Javascript

You can check out this repository if you are also following along CS50W class of 2020 very well presented by Brian Yu (brian@cs.harvard.edu).
There are 9 lectures in total, nicely separated and numbered per folder.

I have also added notes in some lectures, and comments in files to aid in my learning, which can also be helpful to anyone.

Happy learning!
