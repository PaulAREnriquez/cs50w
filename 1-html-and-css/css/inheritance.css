/* Inheritance in SASS */
/*If you would look to the compiled css for this scss file,
there is nothing that we could not have done directly using css.
SASS only makes it simpler to create relationships between elements
using inheritance. */
/* % is used to define a generic attribute, which in terms of css, means things that are similar for different classes*/
