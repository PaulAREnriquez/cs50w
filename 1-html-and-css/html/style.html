    <!--this is how you factor out the css for each element-->
    <!-- you can use the style tag-->
    <!-- and inside it you define the css properties for each tag-->
    <!-- the tags will then be affected according to their style-->
    <!--
    <style>
      h1 {
        color: blue;
        text-align: center;
      }
</style>
  -->
  <!-- here is the proper way to do it-->
  <!-- you link a different css file that contains the styling-->
  <!-- which this webpage will now inherit-->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="../css/style.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1 class="baz">Heading 1</h1>
    <h1 class="baz">Heading 2</h1>
    <h1>Heading 3</h1>
    <!-- this is what's called as "inline styling"-->
    <!-- when you take directly css as a style attribute to each element-->
    <!-- inline styles should be avoided-->
    <h2 style="color: green; text-align: center">Hope you enjoy here!</h2>
    Hello World!

<!--What happens when there are MULTIPLE different
selectors that could apply to the same element?-->
<!--This is the problem of SPECIFICITY-->
<!--There is a particular order that is followed
to determine what style a particular element should follow-->
<!--
  1. inline - most specific using "style"
  2. id - more specific using "id" and #
  3. class - less specific using "class" and "."
  4. type - least specific using the name of the element
